# Autism Predictor for Children

This is a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a child having autism based on a questionnaire filled out by their parent/guardian. The model was developed using [insert programming language, libraries, and tools used].

## How to Use

To use this predictor, simply follow these steps:

1. Download the [insert file name] file from [insert link to where the file can be downloaded].
2. Fill out the questionnaire in the downloaded file with information about your child's behavior.
3. Save the completed questionnaire as a CSV file.
4. Run the predictor by executing the [insert command to run the model] command in your terminal/command prompt and passing in the path to the saved CSV file as an argument.
5. The predictor will output a prediction of the likelihood of your child having autism, with a value between 0 and 1. A higher value indicates a higher likelihood of autism.

## How It Works

The predictor was developed using [insert details on how the model was trained, including the dataset used, the algorithm used, and any preprocessing/feature engineering done]. The model was evaluated using [insert evaluation metrics used and their scores].

## Limitations

It's important to note that this predictor is not 100% accurate and should not be used as a substitute for a professional diagnosis. If you have concerns about your child's behavior, please consult a medical professional.
